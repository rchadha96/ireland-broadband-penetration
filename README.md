# Domestic Broadband Penetration
### Introduction
To study the penetration of broadband networking in Ireland by investigating and analysing the percentage of Irelandâ€™s population that are broadband subscribers at county and electoral division levels with the help of thematic maps. This analysis is used to find out the parts of the country that have higher and lower penetration rates and to observe the trends in the distribution of broadband across the country.

This project is done as a part of coursework for NCG608[A]-Introduction to Geographical Information Science.
